# sharing-guidebook

# Welcome!

Hello! So glad you are here!   :)

This is a project for people who want to create a world-changing biomedical research study or contribute to existing one.  

The aim of the Sharing Guidebook is to create a resource that shows how existing human research studies deploy different approaches to sharing. By looking closely at how different studies deploy sharing practices, the hope is that it will be easier for others to improve their own approaches, practices, and preferences -- whether you are a research scientist or a paticipant in a study.
